         GITHUB STORAGE SOLUTION FOR LOKQ TOKEN & DEXSCREENER COMPATIBILITY
==================================================================================

The good news is that your token logo is already hosted on GitHub:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edfarialand/liquidity-token/main/lokq-logo.png

To complete the process and make your token visible on DEXscreener:

1. STEP 1: CREATE A METADATA JSON FILE
   - We've already created token-metadata.json with your logo URL

2. STEP 2: UPLOAD TO GITHUB
   - Create a repository on GitHub (or use an existing one)
   - Upload the token-metadata.json file
   - Get the "raw" URL to this file (click on the file in GitHub, then "Raw" button)
   - The URL should look like: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/branch/token-metadata.json

3. STEP 3: UPDATE YOUR TOKEN WITH THIS URL
   - Run the following command with your GitHub metadata URL:
     node solana-metadata-update.js <YOUR_GITHUB_METADATA_URL>

4. STEP 4: VERIFY ON DEXSCREENER
   - Once your token is trading, check DEXscreener to ensure your logo appears

Additional tips:
- GitHub is free and reliable for hosting token metadata
- The "raw.githubusercontent.com" URLs are perfect for token metadata
- This approach is commonly used and works well with DEXscreener
